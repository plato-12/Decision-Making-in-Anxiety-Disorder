Open the Input Manager by selecting Edit -> Project Settings -> Input Manager from the menu bar.
Add a new axis by clicking on the "+" button at the bottom of the "Axes" list.
Set the following properties for the new axis:
Name: "Horizontal" (or any other name you prefer)
Type: Joystick Axis
Axis: X Axis
Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a new axis named "Vertical" with Axis set to "Y Axis".
Drag and drop the script onto the player object in your scene.
Now the player should be able to move using the joystick. You can adjust the moveSpeed value to control how fast the player moves.
